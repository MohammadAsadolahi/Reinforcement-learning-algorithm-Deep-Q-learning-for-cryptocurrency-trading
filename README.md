# Reinforcement-learning-algorithm-Deep-Q-learning-for-cryptocurrency-trading
Deep Q learning algorithm for cryptocurrency trade deployed with Tensorflow (keras) in python  
This codde is a single Agent DQN for cryptocurrency stock trade.  
**this project can be applied for !any stock market! to trade with reinforcement learning and its not limited to only use in cryptocurrency trading**   
**this project is a research project and owners have no responsibility of any loss for deploying this project in real environmentn**
